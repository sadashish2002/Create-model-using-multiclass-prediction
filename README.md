# Introduction

In Multi-class classification, we classify data into multiple class labels . Unlike classification trees and k-nearest neighbour, the concept of Multi-class classification for linear classifiers is not as straightforward. We can convert logistic regression to Multi-class classification using multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression; this is a generalization of logistic regression, this will not work for support vector machines. One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) and One vs. One are two other multi-class classification techniques can covert any two-class classifier to a multi-class classifier.


# Softmax Regression ,One-vs-All & One-vs-One for Multi-class Classification

In this repo, we will study how to convert a linear classifier into a multi-class classifier, including multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression, One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) and One vs. One

# Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

* Understand and apply some theory behind:
* Softmax regression
* One vs. All (One-vs-Rest)
* One vs. One
